# Metro-Bike-Share---Root-Cause-Analysis-of-Sales-Performance
Analyzed Metro Bike Share trip data to uncover user behavior, station demand, bike and pass type usage, and weather impacts. Integrated external weather and holiday data, built structured datasets, and delivered insights to optimize bike allocation, boost off-peak usage, and improve customer engagement.

## STAR Response

**S** - Metro Bike Share operates a public bike-sharing system, and the company wanted to better understand user behavior, station popularity, bike type usage, and the impact of weather on trip numbers.

**T** - The team was tasked with analyzing large volumes of trip data to model relationships between stations, bike types, pass types, and external factors like weather and holidays. The goal was to provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve service and user engagement.

**A** - I led data preparation and analysis, including data normalization and cleaning, organizing data into dimension tables, and integrating external data such as weather and holidays. I created visualizations to analyze how weather, pass types, and bike types influenced trip numbers and collaborated to identify popular stations and peak usage times.

**R** - The recommendations—such as offering incentives during less favorable weather, preparing more bikes at popular stations during peak and holiday periods, and launching a loyalty program for pass holders—can help Metro Bike Share attract more customers during off-peak times, improve customer satisfaction at busy stations, and encourage repeat usage through rewards, all of which are likely to drive higher sales and greater overall system usage.
